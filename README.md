### Background Information

I chose this game because I am a big fan of sports, music and movies. This is a sport, music, and movies trivia game that allows the user to choose a category and and answer questions in that category. The user receives 10 points with every correct question. This is a single player and a two-player user game. for the single player, there is no winner, just point accumulation. for two players, there is a winner, loser, or it can be a tie.
